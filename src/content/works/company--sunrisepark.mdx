Saga Sunrise Park ( 佐贺サンライズパーク ) is a large-scale sports and cultural complex in Saga Prefecture, Japan.

In this project, I was responsible for the development and integration of the official website and booking system.

## Responsibilities and Highlights

- Independently led the frontend development and documentation for the official website, ensuring project continuity and quality delivery. During the mid-term personnel adjustment, became the sole frontend developer, taking full responsibility for all frontend features and technical documentation.
- Utilized **React** + **TypeScript** to design the UI, develop key functional components, implement page development, and optimize performance for a multilingual booking and event management platform, with **Sass** adopted for scalable and maintainable styling—significantly enhancing the park’s digital service capabilities and user experience.
- Designed and implemented RESTful and GraphQL APIs using **Django** + **Django REST Framework** to ensure robust backend support.
